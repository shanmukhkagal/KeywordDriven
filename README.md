# KeywordDriven
Data Driven Framework in Selenium is a method of separating data sets from the test case. Once the data sets are separated from the test case, it can be easily modified for a specific functionality without changing the code. It is used to fetch test cases and suites from external files like Excel, .csv, .xml or some database tables.
